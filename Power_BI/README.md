# Power BI Projects

This folder contains Power BI reports (`.pbix`) showcasing data modelling, DAX measures, KPI frameworks, and dashboard design across multiple domains.

## What you’ll see in these reports
- Semantic modelling (star-schema thinking where applicable)
- KPI measures (totals, trends, variance, ratios)
- Report design for clarity and stakeholder readability
- Drill-through, filters, and interactive analysis patterns (where included)

## How to use
1. Download the `.pbix` file.
2. Open in **Power BI Desktop**.
3. If a report uses local file paths, you may need to:
   - Update the data source (Transform Data → Data source settings), or
   - Replace the source with your local version of the dataset.

## Notes / Recommendations
- For best results, keep datasets in a consistent local folder and update paths once.
- If you’d like, I can create a standard “Portfolio Data Sources” setup so every PBIX loads cleanly with minimal path edits.
